			<h2>Physical Attributes</h2>
			<p>
				Domestic shorthairs range in appearance, without one color or pattern being predominant. Some have spots, some have patches and others may have a different colored tail than the rest of their body. Their smooth, shiny coats come in a variety of colors: brown, orange, black, white, and so on. Their eyes can be hazel, blue, green or gold.

 

All variety aside, some common physical traits amongst domestic shorthairs include their round head and paws, muscular bodies and medium tail-length. They tend to have a varied stature and can range anywhere from 6 to 16 pounds, though the females tend to be smaller than the males. Fun fact: their nighttime vision is six times better than humans!

 

These cats tend to stay healthy and live a fairly long life of 12 to 14 years. Routine veterinary care is, as always, recommended and be careful of equating food with love for these kitties – they can get overweight.
