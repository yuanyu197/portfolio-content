			<h2 class="head2">Niannian's History</h2>
			<p>
				Niannian is a Domestic shorthair cat. Friendly, playful, and agreeable are just a few of the words that describe the Domestic shorthair cat personality. They're furry friends that are a welcome addition to busy and calm households alike. He went through many people and chose us eventually.
			    As mentioned, Domestic Shorthair cats make great family pets and are even referred to as “house cats.” They’ve also been called “alley cats,” although that term tends to have a negative connotation. These nicknames can make these cats sound quite generic, but they each have their own unique look and personality.

			<h2 class="head2">Physical Attributes</h2>
			<p>
				Domestic shorthairs range in appearance, without one color or pattern being predominant. Some have spots, some have patches and others may have a different colored tail than the rest of their body. Their smooth, shiny coats come in a variety of colors: brown, orange, black, white, and so on. Their eyes can be hazel, blue, green or gold.

 

All variety aside, some common physical traits amongst domestic shorthairs include their round head and paws, muscular bodies and medium tail-length. They tend to have a varied stature and can range anywhere from 6 to 16 pounds, though the females tend to be smaller than the males. Fun fact: their nighttime vision is six times better than humans!

 

These cats tend to stay healthy and live a fairly long life of 12 to 14 years. Routine veterinary care is, as always, recommended and be careful of equating food with love for these kitties – they can get overweight.
